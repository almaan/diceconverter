## Tool for conversion of images into "dice-representation"

A command line based tool that will allow the user to convert any picture
to a representation of a six-faced die.

One example would be
<img src="https://github.com/almaan/diceconverter/blob/master/res/test_case2_out.png" alt="drawing" width="500" height="500"/>
Turned into
<img src="https://github.com/almaan/diceconverter/blob/master/res/test_case2_out.png" alt="drawing" width="500" height="500"/>
